I wanted to share a story about why the is such a big deal to So this is me after finishing my first half marathon in The run to the beat was sponsored by one of the major selling points of it was you got sent a Nike dry fit with your running number on and everyone ran in the same I trained really felt ready and good about weeks my fancy Nike turned ordered the biggest size an XL and it was way too riled up just completely I called them and asked them if they could change it and got told there was nothing they could do as that was the biggest size that Nike make t shirts I was a size at the A size and a major company considered me too fat to make a A size and it had never occurred to them that someone my size or bigger would want to take All of a sudden I went from looking forward to the event to dreading convincing myself I would be out of place and the fattest person I wasnt as body confident back So I did the the course was twisted my got stung by a wasp it was all a whole thing but I finished it and had been promised that there was a music festival at the Only to find the music festival was practically over and you would only have seen the headline act if you had finished the race in less than hour It was my first half trained as hard as everyone I should have been proud of myself but I spent the whole time pulling down the too tight and self conscious because it was blatantly too small and now being told I fast I felt like exercise was an elite club only for thin people and even though I had done the same course I still good Six years on and I really feel like Nike have turned a massive corner with their plus size Major sports brands are finally realising that guess fat people exercise too and its about Brands need to do particularly sports brands but at least a step in the right direction and if we support them maybe more companies will follow ,1

I wanted to share a story about why the is such a big deal to So this is me after finishing my first half marathon in The run to the beat was sponsored by one of the major selling points of it was you got sent a Nike dry fit with your running number on and everyone ran in the same I trained really felt ready and good about weeks my fancy Nike turned ordered the biggest size an XL and it was way too riled up just completely I called them and asked them if they could change it and got told there was nothing they could do as that was the biggest size that Nike make t shirts I was a size at the A size and a major company considered me too fat to make a A size and it had never occurred to them that someone my size or bigger would want to take All of a sudden I went from looking forward to the event to dreading convincing myself I would be out of place and the fattest person I wasnt as body confident back So I did the the course was twisted my got stung by a wasp it was all a whole thing but I finished it and had been promised that there was a music festival at the Only to find the music festival was practically over and you would only have seen the headline act if you had finished the race in less than hour It was my first half trained as hard as everyone I should have been proud of myself but I spent the whole time pulling down the too tight and self conscious because it was blatantly too small and now being told I fast I felt like exercise was an elite club only for thin people and even though I had done the same course I still good Six years on and I really feel like Nike have turned a massive corner with their plus size Major sports brands are finally realising that guess fat people exercise too and its about Brands need to do particularly sports brands but at least a step in the right direction and if we support them maybe more companies will follow ,1

is toxic and To I am not advocating for the harassment or bullying of overweight I just think that the fat acceptance movement is targeting the obesity problem in the US in the completely wrong There are a lot of fat people in the a there are some societal and cultural problems that have led to I believe the affordability and instant gratification associated with fast food is a huge soda is one of the single most detrimental things to happen to public health since I and then the question becomes how we handle It seems to me that the fat acceptance movement says we should glorify making unhealthy choices and normalize not what we should be teaching our We should be teaching them about heart and We should teach them to control their portions and eat more fruits and up to individuals if they want to make healthy choices or but I think we can change the culture by educating the next generation on good nutrition and the health risks of a poor not by telling them completely normal to be would agree with but would love to hear your,1
Today going to be posting about a topic which is extremely sensitive to something i often talk about but i feel high time i is about BODY though everything around us has evolved and there is so much advacement in science and technology but sad to see that something as mere as our mindset Even though so many people talk about loving yourself and feeling comfortable in your own how many of us actually truely feel that Everyone has some insecurities or something about themselves or their outer appearance like to Although i am a positive i myself struggle with this because we are surrounded by negative and small minded people who always People around us feel that it is absolutely ok to throw their opinion but they fail to realise how it affects our mental When someone comments about your figure or keeps passing hideous jokes about your it does nothing but makes the other person feel concious and they begin to realise how worthless they are which in turn leads to Some of are extreme fitness freaks which is absolutely great because you have made a choice to lead a healthy lifestyle but it mean that there are other people out there who are lazy or Some people have other issues for their sudden or persistent weight it could be due to a health condition or hormonal problem and not because they sit all day on the couch and be lazy or eat junk food high time we respect that and stop judging people based on outer It determine our all of us will perish someday and outer beauty last What i value the most is inner and how we can help others in the smallesy way No one which achieve greatness in life by stepping over someone or putting others down to make themselves feel So lets start being Be humble and be grateful for what you have and most of love yourself for who you Positivity begins from within and we all,1

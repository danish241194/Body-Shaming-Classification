Rant the new and you think people are changing and women are being appreciative of other And you will always find that one woman be acquaintance or who meets you after a while and thinks they should do you the favour of telling you that put on more weight or that looking This goes for the other gender as me break this down for you I need you to tell me what I look like or I most assuredly know this better than Before telling someone how they are learn to ask how they are Before assuming that one is fat because of their eating learn more about Just because you have lost some it does not become your prerogative to comment on anyone weight or for that their You call yourself a well then you must surely be updated with the situations and So why would you be nasty and not Most important of all remember that YOU are full of flaws too and that your close ones accept you the way you are and do not remind you of your short comings or difficult situations in your life whenever you someone needs your they will ask for If you think they are afraid to ask for at least bother spending some time to understand whether they really need your interference or If you want to do something nice for learn to be Learn to be compassionate and hence assume caring and compassionate and hence have the right to make that your new year Peace stopshamingwomen stopbodyshaming youarefullofflawstoo letsrisetogether bodyshaming bodyshamingisnotok learntoacceptchange placewellnessbeforeeverythingelse ,0

Today going to be posting about a topic which is extremely sensitive to something i often talk about but i feel high time i is about BODY though everything around us has evolved and there is so much advacement in science and technology but sad to see that something as mere as our mindset Even though so many people talk about loving yourself and feeling comfortable in your own how many of us actually truely feel that Everyone has some insecurities or something about themselves or their outer appearance like to Although i am a positive i myself struggle with this because we are surrounded by negative and small minded people who always People around us feel that it is absolutely ok to throw their opinion but they fail to realise how it affects our mental When someone comments about your figure or keeps passing hideous jokes about your it does nothing but makes the other person feel concious and they begin to realise how worthless they are which in turn leads to Some of are extreme fitness freaks which is absolutely great because you have made a choice to lead a healthy lifestyle but it mean that there are other people out there who are lazy or Some people have other issues for their sudden or persistent weight it could be due to a health condition or hormonal problem and not because they sit all day on the couch and be lazy or eat junk food high time we respect that and stop judging people based on outer It determine our all of us will perish someday and outer beauty last What i value the most is inner and how we can help others in the smallesy way No one which achieve greatness in life by stepping over someone or putting others down to make themselves feel So lets start being Be humble and be grateful for what you have and most of love yourself for who you Positivity begins from within and we all have a purpose in Know YOU are YOU are And YOU are ,1

Repost from our physical appearance is sacred to as something and fetishized every single whether through social on or as close as our inner With all the other cultural expectations we South Asian women have to meet in addition to this issue is amplified for us even How many of us have heard elders call us when put on a little or simply because we are not a size Not only does this indirect statement hinder the confidence we need to break our but it comes with the dangerous implication that unhealthy is somehow better than you hear this from an aunty an or let them fool you into absurd Remember your body is beautiful and and no amount of narrow mindedness can take away the power it holds to move wake up every morning to kick and rock a sari better than anyone for I might always be too or according to the societal standards always too according to my honestly learnt to respect and nourish my My weight and my dress size are just numbers and I allow them to define of my favorite fitness motivators recently a difference between wanting to change your body to improve and strengthen it and wanting to change your body because you hate important to know the difference because one of those will destroy you from the inside resonates with me on SO MANY had a long journey of from to from fad diets and starvation to maintaining a healthy lifestyle and from trying to get to please people to getting healthy and strong for workout to get strong and not is the mantra I chant a thousand times in front of my need to put a stop to the epidemic of once and for all and get our facts regarding health and fitness Right ,1
So I wanted to talk about this disgusting body shaming article published by the telegraph regarding decision to use a plus size mannequin which apparently feel gives them the right to publish opinions on other not dress it the article is Apparently the or more the women the mannequin represents is not going for a run cannot Well let me just call bullshit on that for a As a plus size woman done half obstacle bike races trained boxing and martial weight training etc my fitness is better than most of my At one point I was doing a running event most Everyone there was different shapes and just doing it because they enjoyed it and supporting each other and yes there was always plenty of plus size people You know what they all had in They were all wearing Sportswear which they had bought from a paid for with the same money regardless of what size they were If plus size people are purchasing the same products why they be able to see what it looks like on a body type more like their No thin person is going to look at a plus size mannequin and think to themselves get but a plus size person might look at the mannequin and feel more included and encouraged to I personally see why a bad There are plus size athletes out playing lifting doing yoga and they all need who is this journalist to say who can and cannot wear a pair of Brands have come a long way with including plus size people and Nike is one of the brands leading the This after their amazing campaign which included the inspirational plus size dancer should not have a size cut off and we should be encouraging more people to enjoy exercise not limiting who can and buy the clothes they need to exercise Well done Nike for representing ,1

I was going through some of my old stuff today and I found some messages given to by my old friends and loved ones many years A lot many advices and suggestions were jotted down from the people who loved me and cared for what I was was that a lot of those messages written by people close to me contained the word or in remembered all the times that people have called me a Also on being called out justified the same by saying that huge meaning huge standards and huge way of living life but in all honestly that was not the When they said words like it was specifically to point out that I was not the conventional size a girl ought to I never took the comments of people it family or Even if I tried to talk about it with seeking explanation for this kind of unacceptable people would sweep it under the carpet by saying ITS LET THEM WHAT THEY But while going through the old messages I felt By I have got a great height which I consider a gift unlike Wherever I go the tallest or six years I was obese which according to me was not a problem but everyone around me made me feel that it was and it should be a cause of concern for The people that are closest to me have often taken to criticism and mean commentary with respect to my I was a very upbeat child so I did not take anything too it is only now I realize with great alarm the depression this behavior could have thrown me shaming is more common that you The people who are closest to you will call you out and body shame while also normalising the culture of body There is no correct body body this unacceptable is an extension of non self reflexivity on part of unwillingness to grow and the tendency to normalise am writing it today because I want anyone to go through Body Whether fat or been proud of it and will be proud of it today and always ,1

For as long as I can wanted to loose idea came when I started gaining weight and everyone around me started calling me get me I bullied as a because not someone who can be just that here and people started teasing that I ever gave a damn about what people ever thought about but the healthy teasing soon started bothering it never bothered me enough to loose the thought about it a joined the gym and given up more times than I can It just seemed like I do I kept on gaining the weight and the teasing kept on been trying to do it because the weight seems like the biggest flaw I face in my daily for the first time in my I actually go to the can see the small difference it has on my I realized I really need to loose the going to do it to get rid of my personal insecurities but not something I NEED to sucks that the world around me has made me and God knows how many people feel that but overweight is not a is a problem but overweight is not something that makes you less sucks that people in our culture understand the concept of body shaming and they feel that absolutely okay to tell someone they need to loose equally harassing as to comment on boobs or their dick size because the weight is also a part of their seen a lot of people hitting the gym and dieting and seen wonderous transitions and so proud of all of but the fact that all of them thought that they needed to loose weight to be beautiful scares beauty a not how much you not how old you live in a culture which is progressing towards fitness and glad to be a part of that but if fitness here means trying to avoid comments of family members and trying to fit then I think a fan of the culture we live just hope more people had the strength to say ,1

is toxic and To I am not advocating for the harassment or bullying of overweight I just think that the fat acceptance movement is targeting the obesity problem in the US in the completely wrong There are a lot of fat people in the a there are some societal and cultural problems that have led to I believe the affordability and instant gratification associated with fast food is a huge soda is one of the single most detrimental things to happen to public health since I and then the question becomes how we handle It seems to me that the fat acceptance movement says we should glorify making unhealthy choices and normalize not what we should be teaching our We should be teaching them about heart and We should teach them to control their portions and eat more fruits and up to individuals if they want to make healthy choices or but I think we can change the culture by educating the next generation on good nutrition and the health risks of a poor not by telling them completely normal to be would agree with but would love to hear your ,0
